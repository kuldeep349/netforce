                            <p>When you get involved in an MLM based business, you are building residual income that will lead to time and financial freedom. That means that even if you don’t go to work on a given day, there are still people in your organization who are working and generating revenue from which you get a part. This gives you time to focus on building your dream business while it also provides the cash necessary to fund that dream as well as useful friends and associates.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="font-weight-7">Your Business</h3>

                             <h3 class="font-weight-7">Your Income</h3>
                             <p>Based on how much you devote to your business – unlimited earning potential.</p>
                              <h3 class="font-weight-7">Your Life</h3>
                              <p>Be limitless. Live intentional; build an extra ordinary life.</p>

                              <p>More and more people are getting tired of corporate jobs and businesses that take too much of their time, robbing them of much-deserved time with their families and loved ones and scarcely provides enough money. Quality time is fast becoming passé—more people want to have the quantity of time to spend with their families.</p>
                              
                              <p><strong>ARE YOU LIVING TO WORK OR WORKING TO LIVE?</strong></p>

                               <p>Some people live simply to work… their lives revolve around earning a paycheck so that they can meet bills and get out of bed again to work the next day… and pay more bills.</p>
                               
                               <p>Others work so that they can live. The fruits of their labor are the time, freedom and money to enjoy life outside of work.</p>
                               
                               <p>Which group do you fall into? If you would prefer to be in the latter group, Helpmate is your solution.
